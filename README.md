Perfect script for lazy people (aka me) in case they want to copy all the directory names from... well, anywhere. The script looks up every name in the given location and prints the names (separated by new lines) into the console


Feel free to modify it however you want.


HOW TO USE IT:

just replace the '<your/directory/path/goes/here>' in the 4th line. (delete the < and >)
